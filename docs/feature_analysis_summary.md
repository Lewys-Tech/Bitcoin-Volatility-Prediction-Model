# Cryptocurrency Volatility Prediction - Feature Analysis Summary

This document provides a comprehensive summary of the key findings from our feature analysis for the cryptocurrency volatility prediction project.

## 1. Volatility Regime Features

### Key Findings
- **Regime Distribution**:
  - Data split into three equal parts (241 days each):
    - Low volatility: 241 days
    - Medium volatility: 241 days
    - High volatility: 241 days
  - Even distribution due to quantile-based splitting

### Regime Duration
- **Average Duration**:
  - Low volatility: ~6.6 days
  - High volatility: ~4.2 days
  - Medium volatility: ~2.1 days
- **Implication**: Low volatility periods are more stable, while medium volatility is more transient

### Regime Transitions
- **Strong Persistence**:
  - Low volatility stays low: 83% of the time
  - High volatility stays high: 84% of the time
  - Medium volatility: 70% persistence
- **Transition Patterns**:
  - Low → High transitions: Rare (2.07%)
  - High → Low transitions: Rare (1.66%)
  - Most transitions occur through medium regime

### Boundary Analysis
- **Low Volatility Regime**:
  - Closest to lower boundary (mean: 0.1473)
  - Farthest from upper boundary (mean: 0.8364)
- **High Volatility Regime**:
  - Farthest from lower boundary (mean: 0.4963)
  - Closest to upper boundary (mean: 0.5232)
- **Medium Volatility Regime**:
  - Moderate distances from both boundaries

## 2. Return Pattern Features

### Return Streaks
- **Distribution**:
  - Positive streaks: 365 occurrences
  - Negative streaks: 358 occurrences
- **Length Characteristics**:
  - Positive streaks: Average 0.95 days
  - Negative streaks: Average 0.81 days
  - Maximum streak length: 7 days for both types
- **Implication**: Frequent alternation between positive and negative returns

### Return Momentum
- **20-day Window Statistics**:
  - Mean: 0.0015 (slightly positive)
  - Standard deviation: 0.0055
  - Range: -0.0098 to 0.0184
- **Implication**: Slight upward bias in returns over 20-day periods

### Return Asymmetry
- **Key Metrics**:
  - Asymmetry ratio mean: 1.56
    - Positive returns are 56% larger than negative returns
  - Skewness mean: 0.16 (slightly positive)
- **Implication**: Larger positive returns than negative returns

### Return Autocorrelation
- **Lag Analysis**:
  - 1-day lag: -0.102 (slight negative autocorrelation)
  - 5-day lag: -0.036 (very weak negative autocorrelation)
  - 10-day lag: 0.026 (very weak positive autocorrelation)
- **Implications**:
  - Short-term mean reversion (negative 1-day autocorrelation)
  - Slight momentum in longer-term returns (positive 10-day autocorrelation)

## 3. Technical Indicators Analysis
